# OPEA Security Working Group Charter

## Mission 

The OPEA Security Working Group aims to establish a "Security First" mindset in the community in
order to prevent and respond to security issues.  

## Problem Statement 

It’s often the case that security is only prioritized after a problem – at which point it’s the
hardest most expensive time to address. Moreover without a structured response process in place
security issues are even more difficult to remediate.

## Scope and Priority 

The Security Working Group will adopt best practices from established security organizations and
educate the community to ensure widespread adoption, i.e., security is everyone's responsibility.
Working Group members will also act as subject matter experts to help review pull requests for
secure design and implementation.

## Decision-making Governance 

Most initiatives are intended to be realized through existing community mechanisms like pull
requests to the main repositories. 
In rare cases where the working group may need to make decisions outside of existing processes
we will prefer consensus decision making and escalate to the TSC as needed.
